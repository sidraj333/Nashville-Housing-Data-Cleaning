# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning

In this project, I utilized MS SQL Server to increase usability within the Nashville Housing Dataset. Specifically, I filled null property address values, and
standardized the format of owner address and property address. Furthermore, I removed duplicates and stored the new dataset into a new table. Lastly, I dropped
unncessary columns to increase usability once again.
